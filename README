I. Adding the meta-opendnp3 layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-opendnp3 layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-opendnp3 layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-meta-opendnp3 \
    "


II. Misc
========

Changes made to OpenDNP3 are aimed at getting it to compile in our
environment, which is mostly vanilla Yocto. Branches in the repo are named for
the equivalent branches in the Yocto poky repo and should compile out of the
box. For the master branch YMMV.

OpenDNP3 is maintained by Automatak, LLC. Vlinder Software assumes no
responsibility for it, or for anything that might arise from its use.
